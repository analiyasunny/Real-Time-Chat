# Real-Time Chat App – In-Class Tutorial Activity

Welcome to our group tutorial on building a real-time chat application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. 
This activity will help you understand the basics of real-time communication on the web.


## Live Demo

Before we start coding, test out the fully working chat app by clicking this link:

[Live Chat App on Render](https://real-time-chat-dfpe.onrender.com))

Open it in **two browser tabs** or share with a friend to test live chatting in action.


## What Is Real-Time Chat?

Real-time chat means users can send and receive messages **instantly** without refreshing the page.
This is made possible using **WebSockets**, which allow continuous two-way communication between the browser and the server.

We’re using a JavaScript library called **Socket.IO** to simplify WebSocket usage.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Optional VS Code Extensions:
- Live Server – For previewing HTML
- Prettier – For formatting your code

##  In-Class Activity Instructions

Let’s build the same chat app together on your local machine!


Open VS Code and your terminal, then run:
