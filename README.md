# Real-Time Chat App – In-Class Tutorial Activity

Welcome to our group tutorial on building a real-time chat application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. 
This activity will help you understand the basics of real-time communication on the web.


## Live Demo

Before we start coding, test out the fully working chat app by clicking this link:

[Live Chat App on Render](https://real-time-chat-dfpe.onrender.com))

Open it in **two browser tabs** or share with a friend to test live chatting in action.


## What Is Real-Time Chat?

Real-time chat means users can send and receive messages **instantly** without refreshing the page.
This is made possible using **WebSockets**, which allow continuous two-way communication between the browser and the server.

We’re using a JavaScript library called **Socket.IO** to simplify WebSocket usage.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Optional VS Code Extensions:
- Live Server – For previewing HTML
- Prettier – For formatting your code


## Resources and platforms used

Frontend (Client-Side)
HTML5 – Structures the chat interface

CSS3 – Styles the UI for better appearance

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Handles user interactions

Socket.IO (Client-side) – Manages real-time communication

Backend (Server-Side)
Node.js – Runs the server

Express.js – Handles HTTP requests and serves static files

Socket.IO (Server-side) – Enables real-time WebSocket communication

Hosting & Deployment
Render – Hosting the live chat app

GitHub – Code repository
